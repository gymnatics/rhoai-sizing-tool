# Project overview

ConfigIQ is a Next.js web application for LLM inference sizing, GPU comparison,
and cost modeling. The frontend uses same-origin Next.js API routes to reach the
AISimulators and aicostings services without exposing service URLs to the browser.

## Audience

- ML engineers sizing GPU clusters for inference
- Platform engineers evaluating cloud vs on-premise costs
- Finance and procurement teams modeling GPU spend

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| Performance | Instant GPU memory and throughput estimate |
| Recommend Sizing | Full inference sizing with batching and quantization |
| KV Cache Calculator | Memory breakdown and KV cache capacity analysis |
| GPU Explorer | Side-by-side GPU comparison table and charts |
| Hybrid Savings | Cloud vs on-premise cost modeling |
| Routing Economics | Multi-tier model routing cost analysis |
| Cluster cost | Estimate costs for multi-node GPU clusters |
