# Detailed architecture

This document describes the current ConfigIQ architecture. The frontend is a
Next.js 16 App Router application; GPU sizing and performance calculations are
provided by the AISimulators service rather than a client-side inference engine.

See [architecture.md](./architecture.md) for the short version and
[DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](./DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) for UI conventions.

## System overview

Next.js App Router
  |-- pages and interactive components
  |-- same-origin /api route handlers
  |     |-- AISimulators proxy and response adapters
  |     |-- aicostings proxies
  |     |-- Hugging Face config lookup
  |     `-- application metrics and health

  `--> AISimulators REST service
       `-- aisimulate SDK: GPU sizing, performance, and memory estimation

Next.js server routes --> aicostings REST service
                          `-- cloud GPU, hardware, and hosted-model pricing
```

In production, deployment is managed outside this repository. The documented
deployment contract is a standalone Next.js container plus the two Python
services, typically behind nginx. See [RELEASE_PROCESS.md](./RELEASE_PROCESS.md).

## Frontend structure

| Area | Location | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| App Router pages | `app/*/page.tsx` | Route-level composition |
| App shell | `components/layout/AppShell.tsx` | PatternFly page, masthead, and sidebar |
| Predict workflow | `app/predict/` | Explicit `/api/predict` performance requests and result display |
| Recommend workflow | `app/recommend/` | GPU sizing requests, including streamed progress |
| KV cache calculator | `app/kv-cache/` | `/api/memory` requests and memory breakdown display |
| Catalog hook | `lib/hooks/useCatalog.ts` | Same-origin GPU, model, and backend catalog |
| Costings hook | `lib/hooks/useCostings.ts` | Same-origin pricing and health data |
| API adapters | `lib/api/` | Request shapes, response normalization, and error handling |
| Legacy catalogs | `lib/gpu-math/` | Historical static data and types; no new sizing formulas |

React components own presentation and user interaction. They should not contain
GPU sizing formulas or call external service URLs directly from the browser.

## Request flows

### Predict performance

1. `app/predict/Performance.tsx` builds an explicit model, system, workload,
   backend, and parallelism request.
2. `lib/api/estimate-adapter.ts` posts it to `/api/predict?include=config,memory`.
3. The Next.js route delegates to `lib/api/predict-proxy.ts`, which calls the
   AISimulators `/predict` endpoint server-side.
4. The adapter normalizes timing, memory, serving configuration, and warnings
   into the `InferenceConfigResult` shape used by the page.

### Recommend sizing

1. The recommend page sends a validated request to `/api/recommend`.
2. `lib/api/recommend.ts` calls AISimulators `/recommend` and normalizes the
   selected configuration, topology, phases, throughput, and memory.
3. Streaming clients request `text/event-stream`; the route emits search-window
   progress while `incrementalRecommend` searches and refines GPU bounds.

### Catalog and pricing

1. `useCatalog` calls `/api/catalog`.
2. The catalog route fetches `/systems`, `/models`, and `/backends` from
   AISimulators and combines them into one browser response.
3. When costings are enabled, `useCostings` calls `/api/costings/models`,
   `/api/costings/systems`, and `/api/costings/health`.
4. Those routes proxy the aicostings service; pricing data is not part of the
   AISimulators sizing response.

## API route map

| Route | Method | Upstream or role |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/recommend` | POST | AISimulators `/recommend`, with normalized and streaming modes |
| `/api/predict` | POST | AISimulators `/predict` |
| `/api/estimate` | POST | Compatibility alias for predict |
| `/api/memory` | POST | AISimulators `/memory` |
| `/api/catalog` | GET | Combined AISimulators systems, models, and backends |
| `/api/gpus` | GET | AISimulators systems transformed to the legacy GPU shape |
| `/api/hf-config` | GET | Hugging Face model configuration lookup |
| `/api/costings/models` | GET | aicostings hosted-model pricing |
| `/api/costings/systems` | GET | aicostings GPU cloud and hardware pricing |
| `/api/costings/health` | GET | aicostings source health |
| `/api/costings/sources` | GET | aicostings source metadata |
| `/api/health` | GET | Application and gateway health |
| `/api/metrics` | GET | Application metrics |

The canonical external service contracts are maintained by the service
repositories and their OpenAPI specifications under `services/`.

## Service structure

```text
services/
  configiq-py/       Shared Python library: catalog, OpenTelemetry, MCP
  aisimulators/      FastAPI wrapper around the aisimulate SDK
  aicostings/        FastAPI pricing service with scheduled scrapers and Valkey
```

The aisimulators wrapper does not reimplement GPU math. The SDK is installed as
an external wheel in the service container. The aicostings service uses the
shared `configiq` package for GPU system identity and display names.

## Design constraints

- Keep sizing and performance formulas in AISimulators.
- Keep pricing collection and normalization in aicostings.
- Keep browser calls same-origin; resolve gateway URLs on the server.
- Define request and response interfaces in `lib/api/` rather than using `any`.
- Use server components by default and add client components only for browser
  APIs, state, or event handlers.
- Use PatternFly v6 and the Red Hat typography and color tokens.

## Adding a new calculation

1. Add or update the AISimulators API contract and service implementation.
2. Add a typed request/response adapter under `lib/api/`.
3. Add or update the corresponding Next.js route handler if a new proxy is
   required.
4. Update the page and tests without duplicating the formula in React.
5. Update this route map and the relevant service OpenAPI documentation.
